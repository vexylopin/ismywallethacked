# Is My Wallet Hacked?
A silly little web project I built to practice HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript, nothing serious here! The site checks if your Polygon wallet holds the $KRAW token and jokingly tells you if your wallet is "hacked." ðŸ˜„

## What It Does?
- Lets you enter a Polygon wallet address
- Checks token balance of $KRAW via Polygonscan API
- Shows a funny message if tokens are found or says youâ€™re safe otherwise
- Has a colorful, cartoonish design for fun vibes

## Who Is This For?
- Anyone curious about $KRAW or just wants a goofy little wallet checker
- Folks learning web development who like simple projects
- Anyone who enjoys silly crypto jokes!

## How To Use?
- Open the site in your browser
- Enter your Polygon wallet address (starts with "0x")
- Click Check and get your result!

## Notes
This site uses the public Polygonscan API, so the wallet info is read-only and public on the blockchain. No real hacking involved, just for laughs! If you want to play with the code, feel free to fork and customize it.
